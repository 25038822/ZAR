#QUADRATIC FORMULA
The Quadratic Formula is A mathematical concept used to calculate the roots of numbers, it is a very useful formula,
it saves mathematicians from spending time finding the roots of quadratic equations

#Features
-it asks the users for the values of the coefficients of the quadratic equation(a ,b ,c)
-it computes the discriminates
-calculates the roots and roots based on the value of the discriminant 

#Benefits
-Saves people the time that would have been spent factorizing manually to find the roots ,
by just receiving the value of the coefficients and computing the roots for the user

 # Language and concepts used
-The programming language is Java.
-Scanner was imported(to allow user to enter input)
-else if statements(to calculate the roots)

#Challenges
We tried to create a method outside the main method to compute the roots but it gave us errors we couldn't solve using basic java syntax
which we have learnt so far, so we ended up doing everything inside the main method.
